# Notes

Informal observations, decisions to revisit, and open questions. The
authoritative design is in `DESIGN.md`; this is the scratchpad of
"things we noticed that don't fit cleanly into a section."

## Naming

- Library prefix: `pending-` (public), `pending--` (internal).
- Emacs faces: `pending-face`, `pending-spinner-face`,
  `pending-progress-face`, `pending-error-face`,
  `pending-cancelled-face`.
- Group: `(defgroup pending nil ...)` under `'tools`.
- Package name on file disk: `pending.el`. No `pending-pkg.el`
  unless `package.el` requires it (Eask handles this).
- Constructor: `pending-make` (verb-leading; matches `gptel-make-tool`
  and the wider `cl-defstruct` `make-X` convention).
- The struct itself is `pending` (so `(pending-p obj)` reads
  naturally).

## Decisions explicitly made and recorded

| # | Decision                                              | Why                                                        |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | One overlay per region, not two                       | org-pending uses two; one suffices because we don't need a separate "anchor" — the placeholder text *is* the anchor. Simpler bookkeeping. |
| 2 | Single global animation timer                         | N timers for N placeholders is wasteful; one tick walks the registry. |
| 3 | Callback API, not promise API                         | Matches every async surface in Emacs. Promise adapter is v2. |
| 4 | Read-only via text properties, not overlay hooks      | Composes with `inhibit-read-only`; standard error message; no surprising hook ordering. |
| 5 | Streaming as a first-class state                      | gptel's pattern is the primary use case; org-pending lacks this. |
| 6 | Distinct `:cancelled` and `:expired` terminal states  | Caller often needs to know "user gave up" vs "deadline hit" vs "remote error" — collapsing into `:rejected` loses information. |
| 7 | Text spinner only in v1, SVG deferred to v2           | TUI must work; SVG is decoration. |
| 8 | `cl-defstruct`, not plist                             | Type-checked accessors; `cl-defmethod` dispatch later if needed. |

## Decisions NOT yet made (revisit during implementation)

- **Description buffer**: org-pending has `*Region Lock*`. Worth the
  ~80 LOC for v1, or push to v2? Lean toward v2 — the use case
  (debugging long-running locks) is real but `pending-list` covers
  most of it.
- **Indirect-buffer projection**: implemented in v0.2 via the
  `pending-protect-adopted-region` defcustom (default t).  In adopt
  mode the library applies `read-only` text properties to the existing
  text; text properties are inherited by indirect buffers and project
  edit protection across them.  Set the option to nil to opt out and
  restore v0.1.0's "adopt mode leaves existing text editable" behaviour.
  No bug filed yet but indirect-buffer support is cheap; see DESIGN.md
  §5 for the principle and `pending-test/protection-projects-into-
  indirect-buffer'.
- **Kill-emacs query**: org-pending blocks Emacs exit until the user
  confirms. We probably want this too, gated by a defcustom defaulting
  to nil (vs org-pending's t) — most pending placeholders should
  not block exit by default.
- **Pulse on resolve**: gptel does
  `pulse-momentary-highlight-region` on response insertion.
  We could do the same in `pending-finish`. Cheap, nice UX. Probably
  v1.
- **Overlay priority value**: DESIGN.md says 100; check no other
  package in the user's setup conflicts (gptel uses default).
- **Bar character set**: eighth-blocks (`▏▎▍▌▋▊▉█`) look great in
  monospace and at most modern fonts but break on minimal
  terminals. Provide a defcustom `pending-bar-style` with
  `eighths`/`ascii` (`#`/`-`) options.
- **Whether to call `force-window-update` after each tick**: probably
  no — just dirty the overlay. Test on Emacs 27 to be sure.

## Edge cases worth a test

- Two pending regions overlap (one inside another's `[start,end]`).
  Expected: undefined behavior; document that overlapping is not
  supported. Detect at `pending-make` time and signal
  `pending-error`.
- Pending in a buffer that becomes file-visiting, gets
  `revert-buffer`d, etc. Expected: revert silently kills overlays
  via `kill-all-local-variables`; we hook `kill-buffer-hook` but
  not `revert-buffer-hook`. Check if a custom
  `revert-buffer-restore-functions` integration is needed.
- Pending region inside a `narrow-to-region` that excludes it.
  Expected: still active (markers track absolute positions), but
  invisible. The visibility heuristic (`get-buffer-window`) covers
  the window-not-shown case but not narrow-excluded. Acceptable;
  document.
- A buffer made indirect via `make-indirect-buffer` after pending
  was created: see org-pending's `org-pending--after-indirect-clone`
  which deletes copied overlays. We should at least install a hook
  to clean up duplicate overlays in indirect buffers.

## Org-pending coexistence

If a user has both libraries loaded, and someone calls
`org-pending` and `pending-make` on the same region, the second
caller's overlay would stack on the first. We should:

- **Not** detect-and-error against org-pending (too coupled).
- Document: "if you're in an Org buffer, prefer `org-pending` for
  Org-aware features (Babel async, dblock); use `pending` for
  generic placeholders."

## Potential v2 / v3 features

- Promise adapter: `pending-as-promise` returning an `aio-promise`.
- SVG spinners with cached image-string per (face,size,frame).
- `pending-finish` accepts a function instead of a string —
  invoked at resolution time with the struct, returns the
  replacement text. Useful for late binding.
- Group-level operations: `pending-cancel-group`,
  `pending-list-group`.
- Sticky lighter showing "longest-running pending: X (35s)".
- `treesit`/`syntax-ppss`-aware insertion: don't break a string
  literal mid-token.
- Persistent restoration: serialize active pendings to file-local
  variables on save, re-mark on load (probably not — pending state
  is inherently ephemeral).

## Code-quality reminders

- All public functions need docstrings with arg/return types and a
  side-effect summary.
- Use `cl-typecase` over `pcase` when dispatching on types
  (gptel's convention).
- `byte-compile-file` must be warning-free.
- `M-x checkdoc` clean.
- Use `;;;###autoload` only where the function is interactive or
  used early in init.
- Avoid `eval-after-load 'org` glue in v1 — the goal is Org
  independence.
- No `cl-loop` if `dolist` / `dotimes` / `seq-do` will do; gptel
  uses `cl-loop` heavily, but readability matters more.

## Coordination with `org-pending` upstream

- After v1 ships, send a short note to the org-mode list
  cross-linking the two libraries.
- If `org-pending` lands in Emacs core, consider extracting the
  shared bits into a third-party library both can build on
  (probably overkill — keep separate).

## Aesthetic tuning to do during dev

- Try `:background` colors on `pending-face` against:
  - `modus-operandi` / `modus-vivendi`
  - `doom-one` / `doom-solarized-light`
  - default `light` / `dark`
- The DESIGN.md defaults (`#1e3a5f` / `#e8f0fa`) are reasonable
  starting points. Adjust by hand on each theme.
- The spinner color (`#ffd866`) should pop against most backgrounds
  but check `solarized-light`.

## Out-of-scope for this design pass

- Persistent storage of pending state.
- Network protocol for cross-Emacs-instance pending.
- Integration with specific LLM SDKs (kept at the example level).
- Multi-region pending (a single placeholder spanning disjoint
  regions).
- Hooks for animation styling beyond `defcustom` knobs.
